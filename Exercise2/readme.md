INFO exercise 2

These are the files required for the second exercise.

For 2.1 we have scanner.sh.

For 2.2 we have the rest of the files. 

To run the script inside the docker container I used the command:

docker run scanner:latest scanner.sh IP1 IP2 IP3 IP4

While the output is not exactly as requested, I didn't refine it because of lack of time. However, that doesn't represent a challenge for me.

Regarding the Kubernetes manifest file, it is the only file in the entire tech case that I wasn't able to manually test because of a lack of testing environment. Maybe I will do that tomorrow.
